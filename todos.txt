TODO trainer for generator training

# Must be done
TODO train readout Antolikdata (either learn gaussian or use other readout)
TODO Linear filter analysis
TODO train readout Lurzdata
TODO try core spatialxfeaturelinear 
TODO reread Sinzlab papers
TODO strategically: reimplement model architecture and trainer, just on images and responses, so that antolik and lurz can be compared or try to use antolik on trained lurz model

# Should be done
TODO sort the whole dataset handling mess i made
TODO reorganization of modules according to concepts
TODO rename all private modules
TODO Testing
TODO change all np.save to torch.save for tensors and check type for all loading 

# Would be nice
TODO figure out if import csng_invariances. ... or ...
TODO refactor dataset

# Notes
Image preprocessing:
    - option 1: unprocessed
    - option 2: zero mean unit standard deviation
    - option 3: globally scalled to be between 0 and 1
    - option 4: combination of 2 and 3. 
    - option 5: normalize by dividing through standard deviation
    In Walker et al. 2019: everything is normalized
    In Kovacs 2021: activations normalized by devision through standard deviation and images to zero mean and unit standard deviation
